# LaTeX Report Template for XMU

A compact and easy-to-use template for reports and homework articles in LaTeX.

## Why

As the reports and homework are going to contain more and more formulas and codes, Word makes typesetting difficult and makes it hard to form a consisting style for all my documents. Therefore I use LaTeX for as many writings as I can, and for the sake of starting quickly, I make these templates.

## Quick Tutorial

To control most of the generated content like the cover and page header, these code in the beginning of the file should be changed.

```latex
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newcommand{\StudentNumber}{112233445566}  % Fill your student number here
\newcommand{\StudentName}{Johnson}  % Replace your name here
\newcommand{\PaperTitle}{How to Barbecue}  % Change your paper title here
\newcommand{\PaperType}{Programming Report} % Replace the type of your report here
\newcommand{\Date}{December 4, 2001}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
```
